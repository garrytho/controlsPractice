Basic Controls / Industrial Engineering Practice - Thomas Garry:

This is my first attempt at creating a basic industrial control panel in an effort to learn about controls engineering. The panel features two relays: one which latches when a pushbutton closes, and a second that drives the motor from a separate power source. The second motor also latches with the first, as it is in series with it.
