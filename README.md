Basic Controls Practice - Thomas Garry:

This is my second attempt at building a basic control system to learn industrial automation / controls engineering. This version was built in Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench and runs on a simulated Micro800 PLC. It simulates a multi-zone conveyor system where boxes are detected, processed, and handed off between zones. Each zone has its own motor logic and timers to model realistic travel/transfer delays, and the system supports multiple boxes moving through the line at once.
